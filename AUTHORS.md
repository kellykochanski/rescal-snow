# Authors and contributors 

This software, rescal-snow, was conceived and adapted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) from 2018-2019.
It was developed from version 1.6 of the Real-Space Cellular Automaton Laboratory (ReSCAL v1.6), which was developed at IPGP beginning in 2004.

## LLNL and CU contributors (2018-2019)
 - Kelly Kochanski, <kelly.kochanski@gmail.com>, (designed rescal-snow features, added rescal_utilities, cleaned up I/O, wrote docs, misc debugging)
 - Eric Green (simplified configuration/dependencies, simplified and selectively modularized source code, optimized random number generator, misc debugging)
 - Barry Rountree, <rountree4@llnl.gov>, (configured software for parallel/Mac use, misc debugging)
 - Carlos Downie (added fft utility and tests)
 - Adam Rubin (added snowfall feature)
 - Aaron Robeson (added xcorr utility)
 - Divya Mohan (misc debugging)

## IPGP contributors (2004-2016)
The original software, ReSCAL, was written (2004-2014) in the Laboratoire de Dynamique des Fluides Geologiques, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris.
Rescal-snow would not exist without this development, in code or in concept.
However, these authors are not responsible for changes in rescal-snow after 2016; see docs/NEWS.md for details. For their continued and parallel work with ReSCAL, see http://www.ipgp.fr/~rozier/rescal/rescal.html .
