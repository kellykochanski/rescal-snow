# Authors and contributors 

This software, rescal-snow, was conceived and adapted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) from 2018-2019.
It was developed from version 1.6 of the Real-Space Cellular Automaton Laboratory (ReSCAL v1.6), which was developed at IPGP beginning in 2004.

## LLNL and CU contributors (2018-2019)
 - Kelly Kochanski, <kelly.kochanski@gmail.com>, (designed rescal-snow features, added rescal_utilities, cleaned up I/O, wrote docs, misc debugging)
 - Eric Green (simplified configuration/dependencies, simplified and selectively modularized source code, optimized random number generator, misc debugging)
 - Barry Rountree, <rountree4@llnl.gov>, (configured software for parallel/Mac use, misc debugging)
 - Gian-Carlo Defazio (added heightmap and cellspace utilities, measured effects of stochastic behavior in rescal-snow)
 - Carlos Downie (added fft utility and tests)
 - Richard Barnes (simplified build using cmake, misc review and debugging)
 - Adam Rubin* (added snowfall feature)
 - Aaron Robeson (added xcorr utility)
 - Divya Mohan (misc debugging)
 - Jenna Horrall (misc debugging)

## IPGP contributors (2004-2016)
Rescal-snow would not have been possible without the development of ReSCAL, which was written 2004-2014 at the Laboratoire de Dynamique des Fluides Geologiques, Institute de Physique du Globe de Paris.
