# Authors and contributors 

This software, rescal-snow, was conceived and adapted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) from 2018-2019.
It is a significant modification of the Real-Space Cellular Automaton Laboratory (ReSCAL), which was developed at IPGP beginning in 2014.

## LLNL contributors (2018-2019)
 - Kelly Kochanski*, <kelly.kochanski@gmail.com>, (designed rescal-snow features, added rescal_utilities, cleaned up I/O, wrote docs)
 - Barry Rountree, <rountree4@llnl.gov>, (configured software for parallel/Mac use, misc debugging)
 - Eric Green (removed extraneous code, simplified configuration/dependencies, optimized random number generator, misc debugging)
 - Carlos Downie (added fft utility and tests)
 - Adam Rubin* (added snowfall utility)
 - Aaron Robeson (added xcorr utility)
 - Divya Mohan (misc debugging)

## IPGP contributors (2004-2016)
The original software, ReSCAL, was written (2004-2014) in the Laboratoire de Dynamique des Fluides Geologiques, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris.
This work would not exist without this development.
However, these authors are not responsible for changes in rescal-snow after 2016; see docs/NEWS.md for details. For their continued and parallel work with ReSCAL, see http://www.ipgp.fr/~rozier/rescal/rescal.html .
