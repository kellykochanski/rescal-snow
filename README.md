### 1. Motivation

When wind blows over snow, it self-organizes. This forms surface features, such as ripples and dunes, that alter the reflectivity and thermal conductivity of the snow.

![](docs/example_images/field_examples.png)

Studying these features in the field is cold and challenging ([we've tried](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-45)), so
we created rescal-snow to enable snow scientists to study snow features in controlled numerical experiments.
We hope that this model will be useful to researchers in snow science, geomorphology, and polar climate.

Rescal-snow is able to simulate:

 - Snow/sand grain erosion and deposition by wind
 - Snowfall
 - Time-dependent cohesion (snow sintering)
 - Avalanches of loose grains

Rescal-snow is also designed for robust, reproducible science, and contains tools for high-performance computing, data management, and data analysis, including:

 - Workflow tools for generating and running many simulations in parallel
 - A python-based workflow that manages data and analysis at runtime


## 2. Getting started

### 2.1 Prerequisites

We assume you have reasonable familiarity with bash and terminal commands.
If you have never used bash, we recommend you stop and work through a short tutorial.
(Our favorite is ['The Unix Shell' from Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).)
If you modify rescal-snow, you will need to modify and compile C code. We have also included some setup and analysis tools (used in Example 5) written in Python.

### 2.2 Dependencies

 * C compiler (GCC and CLANG are known to work)
 * [CMake] >= 3.9 (used for compiling)
 * make (used for compiling)
 * [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) (known to work with v1.6.37)
 * [zlib](https://www.zlib.net) (known to work with 1.2.11)
 * Optional packages used for analysis (see the [analysis](analysis) and [scripts/utilities](scripts/utilities) directories):
   * Python3 (used for analysis)
   * numpy (used by Python3 for analysis)
   * pandas (used by Python3 for analysis)
   * scipy (used by Python3 for analysis)


On a Debian-based/Ubuntu Linux machine, the dependencies can be acquired using: 

```bash
sudo apt install gcc cmake make libpng-dev zlib1g-dev python3 python3-numpy python3-pandas python3-scipy
```

On most machines, the Python packages can also be acquired using:

```bash
pip3 install numpy pandas scipy
```

### 2.3 Download
Download rescal-snow by cloning this repository with git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kellykochanski/rescal-snow.git
cd rescal-snow
```

You may also download the repository manually from [Github](https://github.com/kellykochanski/rescal-snow).

### 2.4 Installation

In a terminal, navigate into the main rescal-snow directory (shown above). Run:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -Wno-dev -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. #Debug can be used instead of Release
make -j 4                                    #Adjust to the number of cores you have for a speedy build
```

## 3. Features

The examples below are fully described in the tutorial: [docs/rescal-snow-tutorial.md](docs/rescal-snow-tutorial.md).
The [docs](docs) folder also contains descriptions of additional configuration and analysis options; check these if you're looking for functionality not found in the tutorial.

### 3.1 Sand and snow dunes

The default configuration for Rescal-snow simulates snow (or sand) dune formation. This simulates processes including air flow; grain entrainment, saltation, suspension and deposition; and granular avalanches.

In these conditions, a pile of sand/snow (left) evolves into a dart-shaped barchan dune (middle), then dwindles as grains blow away without being resupplied (right).

|Initial condition, t = 0t0 	|  t = 30t0   | t = 90t0  |
|------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| ![](docs/example_images/snow_cone/00.png) | ![](docs/example_images/snow_cone/03.png) | ![](docs/example_images/snow_cone/09.png) |

Each of the three images above shows a shaded top-down view of a dune (top left), cross-sections through the dune, along the dashed lines (middle left, top right), and a cross-section showing the pressure intensity in the fluid (bottom left).

### 3.2 Sintering snow

Snow cohesion increases over time: this is called sintering.
Rescal-snow is able to simulate the transition of loose (beige) grains into sintered (light purple) grains within waves and dunes.

![](docs/example_images/sintering/sintering.gif)

### 3.3 Dune growth by snowfall

Rescal-snow simulates snow by adding loose grains to the top of the simulation. The gif at the top of this page shows a height-map of a field of dunes and waves growing during snowfall.

### 3.4 Parallel instances and parameter space exploration
We believe that building robust, trustworthy models is much simpler when it's easy to make many model runs.

Rescal-snow contains a series of tools for running many simulation instances in parallel, and managing the associated flows of input and output data.

The following phase diagram shows images produced by ten parallel runs simulating different rates of snowfall (lambda\_I) and wind speed (Tau\_min).
